# CodeJam - SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment & ABAP RESTful Programming Model

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment & ABAP RESTful Programming Model. Prerequisites and recommendations for this CodeJam are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### CodeJam overview

This CodeJam brings...

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

### Further experimentation

If you want to further your learning based on what you've built in these exercises, we suggest you extend the workflow definition you've created to add more features. For example, you could set up a Mail Task with appropriate configuration to send a message.
